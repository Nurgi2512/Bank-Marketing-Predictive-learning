# Bank-Marketing-Predictive-learning
The data is related to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe to a term deposit.

Thank God, this project was awarded as the "Best Final Project" by dibimbing.id, my data science bootcamp institution.
