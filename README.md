# Bank-Marketing-Predictive-learning
The data is related to direct marketing campaign (phone calls) from a banking institution in Portugal. The classification goal is to predict whether the client will subscribe to a term deposit. The dataset can be found in the Bank Marketing Dataset. Alhamdulillah, this project serves as the Final Project guided by dibimbing.id, a data science bootcamp institution where I study.
